\section{Collaboration}\label{partnership}
As noted above, this project is to be completed by Taylor Killian and Leonhard Spiegelberg with careful guidance by Prof. Singer. We anticipate that this project will take our full coordinated effort to complete a worthwhile result by the end of the semester. We have already begun trying to understand the literature and underlying structure of the Sparse Regression/Dictionary Selection problem formulation, including all assumptions that have been made to facilitate approximate solutions. We anticipate that multiple meetings per week will be necessary to ensure consistent progress. 

\section{Model/Problem} \label{model}
Introduce the problem and it's complexities

Here we'll want to add some information about Sparse regression, set functions and definitions of sub modular and super modular, Dictionary Selection, Greedy Methods, etc.
